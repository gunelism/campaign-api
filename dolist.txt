Step 1: Setting Up the Project
	1.	Backend: Set up a Node.js project using Express for the API.
	â€¢	Initialize the project with npm init.
	â€¢	Install necessary dependencies like express, body-parser, and optionally dotenv for environment variables.
	â€¢	Create a basic API structure (routes, controllers, and middleware).
	2.	Frontend: Set up a React project with TypeScript.
	â€¢	Use create-react-app with TypeScript template or vite for a lightweight setup.
	â€¢	Install required dependencies, e.g., axios for API requests.

Step 2: Backend - Campaign Management API
	1.	Database Schema:
	â€¢	Campaign attributes:
	â€¢	id (auto-generated, unique)
	â€¢	title (string, required)
	â€¢	landingPageURL (string, required)
	â€¢	isRunning (boolean, default false)
	â€¢	payouts (array of objects with country and amount).
	2.	API Endpoints:
	â€¢	POST /campaigns: Create a new campaign.
	â€¢	PUT /campaigns/:id/toggle: Toggle the isRunning flag.
	â€¢	GET /campaigns: List all campaigns with optional filters for title, URL, and status.
	â€¢	GET /campaigns/:id: Get campaign details.
	â€¢	DELETE /campaigns/:id: Delete a campaign.

Step 3: Frontend - React Components
	1.	Pages/Components:
	â€¢	Campaign List:
	â€¢	Display all campaigns.
	â€¢	Include search and filter functionality.
	â€¢	Create/Edit Campaign:
	â€¢	Form to add or edit a campaign (title, URL, payouts).
	â€¢	Campaign Details:
	â€¢	Show details of a single campaign.
	â€¢	Controls:
	â€¢	Button to toggle the campaign status.
	2.	State Management:
	â€¢	Use React Context or a state management library like Redux if necessary.
	3.	API Integration:
	â€¢	Use axios or fetch for API communication.
	â€¢	Centralize API calls in a utility file or custom hooks.

Step 4: Bonus Features
	1.	Implement search and filter functionality on the backend for better performance.
	2.	Add a single test case for a critical part of the application (e.g., backend API validation or React form validation).
	3.	Deploy the app (e.g., Vercel for frontend and Render for backend).
